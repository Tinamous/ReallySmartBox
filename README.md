Really Smart Box 
==================================

Stock managment is difficult. This project aims to reduce the overhead and guess work in stock control of day to day items that are easily overlooked and time consuming to keep track of re-ordering.

Constructed of two acrylic sheets cut to fit inside a Really Useful Box (19XL) with two load cells inbetween to sense the weight and a BME 280 to monitor temperarure and humidity. Uses an Arduino Sigfox MKR FOX 1200 to read the sensors and push the measured values out via the Sigfox network.

Really Smart Box Solution:
-----------------

* Uses a regular 'Really Useful Box' for storage.
* A drop in system for the box so very little overhead is needed.
* Independant
** Low power. You don't want your storage solution having to have a power pack.
** No WiFi or client internet set-up. Many companies won't allow "gadgets" an internet connection
